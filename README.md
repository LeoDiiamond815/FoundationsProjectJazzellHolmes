<p> The most important things in my life are my daughter and my music. My daughter reminds me of everything that can go right in the world and music helps me escape when I feel like everything is wrong. Im a firm believer in Science, I enjoy studying astrophysics, and aliens exist. I believe 9/11 was an inside job and our government is poisoning us. Decalcifying the penial gland is the key to transcendendance.</p>
 <p> I became interested in coding when i had an amazing idea for an app. i had no idea where to beegin and i couldnt afford to hire any kinds of developeres so i decided to teach myself. i never thought i would actually bem good at this but Lo! look at me! i cant wait to get started :D </p>
